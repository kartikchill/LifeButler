# LifeButler

LifeButler isn’t just another habit tracker. It ditches the pressure of daily streaks and swaps it for real, honest progress you actually stick with—using simple, fixed commitment cycles.

## 🧠 Why Build This?
Most habit apps push you with streaks and endless little rewards. That sounds nice, but let’s be real: it usually leads to people cheating, burning out, or just giving up after one missed day. LifeButler flips the script. Here, it’s all about sticking to your word and building discipline—not chasing dopamine hits.

## ✨ How It Works
- Set commitments for a week or a month at a time
- Built-in cooldowns stop you from gaming the system
- Progress stands on its own—no more worrying about streaks
- At the end of each cycle, review how you really did
- Clean, simple design keeps distractions out of your way
